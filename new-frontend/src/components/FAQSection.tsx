const faqs = [
  { q: "What is an ATS and why does it matter?", a: "An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is software used by most large companies to filter resumes before a human ever sees them. If your resume isn't ATS-friendly, it gets rejected automatically. JOBRA ensures your resume passes these filters." },
  { q: "How does the AI resume analysis work?", a: "Upload your resume (PDF or DOCX), and our AI engine scans it for ATS compatibility, keyword density, formatting issues, and section structure. You get a detailed score breakdown plus actionable suggestions." },
  { q: "Is my data safe and private?", a: "Absolutely. All uploads are encrypted. Your resume data is auto-deleted within 24 hours. We never share your information with third parties." },
  { q: "What's the difference between General, Role, and JD analysis?", a: "General Analysis checks overall ATS formatting. Role-based Analysis matches your resume against a specific job title. JD Analysis compares against a specific job description for the most accurate match score." },
  { q: "How does the AI resume improvement work?", a: "After analysis, our AI rewrites your content — adding quantified achievements, industry keywords, action verbs, and proper formatting. The improved version loads into our resume builder." },
  { q: "Can I use JOBRA for free?", a: "Yes! The free plan includes 3 resume scans per month with general ATS scoring. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited features." },
  { q: "What file formats are supported?", a: "We support PDF, DOC, and DOCX files up to 2MB. Our resume builder exports in both PDF and DOCX formats." },
  { q: "How accurate is the ATS score?", a: "Our AI has been trained on data from major ATS systems. We maintain high accuracy in predicting ATS pass rates, validated against thousands of real submissions." },
